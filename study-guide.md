# Purpose of the course in the curriculum

Knowing the world of cybersecurity today should prepare you to defend your systems against the attacks of tomorrow. In this course, we will explore the basics of blue teaming: to be able to understand the basic defensive steps needed in every system and network that you will administer. Systems that are 100% secure are not usable or powered down. We will never reach a fully secure system, but not acting will definitely make our systems much less secure.

In this course, we will explore the realms of Cybersecurity. For some of you, this will become a full career path. Others will retain this knowledge in the background of their careers, well knowing that security of the systems is something that always should be taken care of.

This course is one of the last stops in your path of IT Operations (3e phase, 1st semester). In order to tackle this course and the labs, some basic knowledge and skill set is expected from you. Please refer to the [prerequisites](./prerequisites.md) . Take the time to carefully read through this page and tackle the material if necessary.

## Objectives

The student is able to ...

-   map the complexity of securing the entire ICT infrastructure, on every part of the system.
-   use tools to detect and prevent attacks on an IT system (intrusion detection and prevention, network segmentation, endpoint detection, ...).
-   perform a risk analysis to identify the most important security problems in an it system and give advice on how to secure it effectively.

## Theoretical learning materials

The theoretical content is selected from material found all over the world wide web. This can include, but is not limited to material on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/), videos on [Panopto](https://hogent.cloud.panopto.eu), ... .

### Mandatory

We provide a week-to-week guideline with topics to pick up your (online) study. They provide a ground knowledge of the domain of defense in Cybersecurity. These topics should help as well in tackling the labs by having a theoretical foundation. Do not forget you will be questioned on this theoretical material during the exam. As a study method, you should build up your summary notes after each moment of self-study. Ask yourself enough questions and transition from a traditional student to a life-long-learner.

## Lab work (lab environment)

During class hours, more practical hands-on lab material will be covered. You will start with a lab environment, depicting a basic SME network. Every week, we will broaden the security systems you can install in such a professional environment. After lab hours, you can finish up your installation during your own time.

Scenario:

-   You are a new recruit joining an existing (company) environment.
-   You get access to "all" systems as a system and networking administrator.
-   You are tasked with analyzing and improving the security.

Your job:

-   Take notes about the insecure things.
-   Figure out a way to make it more secure (if possible).
-   This includes in understanding what is not secure and if you take actions to make it more secure, you are expected to know how to revert back to the insecure state.

Our job:

-   Providing guidelines and materials during lab hours.
-   We are "senior colleagues" who want to help you as a fellow colleague but with limited time.

On the exam:

-   We will ask you to explain and/or demonstrate your security research and implementations.
-   This will include, but is not limited to, demonstrating the steps to successfully finish lab exercises.

## Teaching methods

### Flipped classroom

This course will use a flipped-classroom approach: the theory is explained using videos and material from external sources. This shall be assessed by every student before coming to the lectures. About 90 minutes of self-lecture materials per week is what you are up for. This will allow us to work hands-on with the concepts that you have learned during class hours. Beware: if you are unprepared, your presence in class will be pretty useless and working on labs will be of no use to you. Contact moments during class hours of course can be used to ask questions on the materials that you have studied, if something would be unclear. Also, the other way round, tutors might ask some questions to you!

### Contact moments (Gent, Aalst, international students)

Hands-on lab work will be the focus of contact moments, so that you get a better grip on the theory while doing things in a real life scenario. During class hours you should learn by doing!

### TIAO students

The flipped classroom concept presents the course materials in an ideal format for remote students as well: the course material and video lectures are available for who studies at his own pace. Lab assignments then can be pursued in your own time as well. When bumping into questions, these can be bundled into the contact moments that you have during the semester. Contact via e-mail is an alternative if you would get really stuck.

## Planning (draft, subject to change)

| Week | Topic                                                            |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Introduction, Setup & Recap Sniffing (including Wireshark + DNS) |
| 2    | Attacking & Firewalling: Analyzing the environment + Scanning    |
| 3    | IDS/IPs setup using suricata                                     |
| 4    | t.b.a.                                                           |

## Evaluation

The exam of this course will be an oral exam: each student will have max. 10 minutes to present/explain/demo his security implementations using his own lab environment, and will be questioned on the mandatory theoretical topics for the remainder of the time.
